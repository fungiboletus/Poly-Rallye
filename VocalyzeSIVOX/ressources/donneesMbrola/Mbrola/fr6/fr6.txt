2.0 A brief description of FR6
--------------------------------------------------------------
FR6-BE 2.00b  release  (alias SAMPA  release )   is a  French  diphone
database  provided   in the   context  of   the  MBROLA   project (see
http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis). 

It provides  a French male voice  (the  author's one, actually)  to be
used with the MBROLA program. 

Input  files  use  the  SAMPA (SAM   Phonetic   Alphabet)  notation as
recommended  by the EEC-SAM  Project. Here  is  a  list of the  French
phonemes it accounts for, with examples. 

(NB : the table   below is encoded as  ASCII  ISO8859-1; use an  ASCII 
editor to see it correctly )

SAMPA	EXAMPLES
i	idiot, ami
e	ému, été
E	perdu, maison
a	alarme, patte
A	bâton, patte
O	obstacle, corps
o	auditeur, beau
u	coupable, loup
y	punir, élu
2	creuser, deux
9	malheureux, peur
@	petite, fortement
e~	peinture, matin
a~	vantardise, temps
o~	rondeur, bon
9~	lundi, brun
j	piétiner, choyer
w	quoi, fouine
H	huile, nuage
p	patte, repas, cap
t	tête, net
k	carte, écaille, bec
b	bête, habile, robe
d	dire, rondeur, chaud
g	gauche, égal, bague
f	feu, affiche, chef
s	soeur, assez, passe
S	chanter, machine, poche
v	vent, inventer, rêve
z	zéro, raisonner, rose
Z	jardin, manger, piège
l	long, élire, bal
R	rond, charriot, sentir
m	madame, aimer, pomme
n	nous, punir, bonne
N	jumping, smoking
_	(silence marker)

Limitations:
-----------
Notice that  SAMPA 'h' (halte,hop) is not  accepted by MBROLA and that
SAMPA 'J'  (agneau, peigner, règne) should be  entered as two separate
phonemes : 'n' and 'y'. 

Note   also  that not   all diphones   are possible   in  French. Some
"impossible" ones will trigger a replacement one:  

9-a,9-@,9-i,9-O,9-y,9-o,9-u,9-e,9-E,9-9
9-2,9-a~,9-o~,9-e~,9-9~,9-k,9-S,9-d,9-j,9-m
9-s,9-t,9-z,9-ng,9-H,9-w,9-_ 
trigger their @-* equivalent. 

N-N (rather unlikely, isn't it ?) will trigger N-g

H-@,H-y,H-u,H-b,H-k,H-S,H-d,H-f,H-g,H-l,H-m,
H-n,H-p,H-R,H-s,H-t,H-v,H-z,H-N,H-H,H-w,H-j,
H-_
will trigger y-*

Of course  those units may  not have the quality   you request, but we
recommend not generating them from the start, in your TTS system. They
potentially imply wrong vocalic hamonizations  for 9-* and wrong rules
with H-*.

3.0 Distribution
--------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution of mbrola contains the following files : 

   fr6      : the database itself
   fr6.txt  : This file
    
and a number of example .PHO files : 

   bonjour.pho            "bonjour"
   ceserait.pho           "ce serait certes une invention considerable ...
   claire                 "a la claire fontaine, m'en allant promener ...
   coup.pho					  "qu'est-ce t'as la ...
   jaiete.pho             "j'ai ete concu dans les laboratoires de la ...
   mavoix.pho				  "ma voix est synthetise grace a ....
   nouspouv.pho           "nous pouvons definir le son comme un coup ...
   tagada.pho             "tagada tagada, tsoin tsoin"
   trenet.pho             "je chante, je chante soir et matin ...

The file mbroli.ini, when used with the Mbroli  pho play under windows
platforms automatically   set the database to  fr6.  It means  you can
double click on any of the .pho file and listen to the voice.

Additional  languages and  voices,  as well as   other example command
files,   are or  will  be  available  in  the  context of  the  MBROLA
project. Please consult the MBROLA project homepage :  
   http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis

Registered users will automatically be notified of the availability of
new  databases.   To    freely register, simply   send   an   email to
mbrola-interest-request@tcts.fpms.ac.be  with  the word 'subscribe' in
the message title. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
4.0 Installation and Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you have  not copied the  MBROLA  software yet, please  consult the
MBROLA project homepage and get it. 

Copy fr6.zip into the mbrola directory and unzip it : 

   unzip fr6.zip (or pkunzip on PC/DOS)
   (don't forget to delete the .zip file when this is done)

Try 

   mbrola fr6/fr6 TEST/bonjour.pho bonjour.wav

to create  a sound file for the  word  'bonjour'. In this  example the
audio file follows the RIFF Wav format. But depending on the extension
bonjour.au, bonjour.aif, or  bonjour.raw you   can obtain other   file
formats. Listen  to it  with your  favorite sound  editor, and try the
other command files  (*.pho) to have a better  idea of the  quality of
speech you can synthesize with the MBROLA technique. 

On  Unix systems you can pipe  the audio ouput  to the sound player as
on a HP : mbrola fr6 bonjour.pho - | splayer -srate 16000 -l16

Also refer to  the readme.txt file  provided with the mbrola  software
for using it.
